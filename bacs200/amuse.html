    <h1>A Few Laughs For a Down Day</h1>
    <h3>by Nick Shermock</h3>

    <p>Any time I log onto the internet, there always seems to be a video that makes me laugh no matter how Iâ€™m feeling. Below are some of my favorite media links, I hope these links can cheer someone up when they are feeling down!</p>
  
    <h2>Various Twitter Videos</h2>
    <p>Twitter is hands down my favorite source of laughs on the internet. Twitter is so appealing because the posts on the site are very relevant to topics trending in media. Another reason is because there are so many witty users, the users pair content with four words and have me in tears.  Similar to Reddit, Twitter doesn't always seem to have the appropriate sense of humor so be forewarned when viewing the platform.</p>
