    <h1>A Few Laughs For a Down Day</h1>
    <h3>by Nick Shermock</h3>

    <p>Any time I log onto the internet, there always seems to be a video that makes me laugh no matter how Iâ€™m feeling. Below are some of my favorite media links, I hope these links can cheer someone up when they are feeling down!</p>
  
    <h2>Various Twitter Videos</h2>
    <p>Twitter is hands down my favorite source of laughs on the internet. Twitter is so appealing because the posts on the site are very relevant to topics trending in media. Another reason is because there are so many witty users, the users pair content with four words and have me in tears.  Similar to Reddit, Twitter doesn't always seem to have the appropriate sense of humor so be forewarned when viewing the platform.</p>

    <h2>TBT Laughs From Way Back</h2>
    <p>Sadly, there's no guarantee a particular page or even an entire website will be around forever.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>.  I have fond memories of this site listing out some of the best Chuck Norris facts, some of which have lived their way on to infamy.  Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
