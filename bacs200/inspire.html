        My inspiration is a unique character. A hero in the eyes of many young sporting fans.
        His name is Dave Portnoy, the creator of Barstool one of the largest media outlets for counsumers.
        Barstool has various different sources of reach such as podacast, social media pages, etc. Dave has
        revolutionzed the sporting industry worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the admirable characteristics Dave has includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vocal - willing to say what others aren't</li>
        <li>Innovative - condsidered a thought-leader in business</li>
        <li>Daring - knows that sometimes risk is required for the reward</li>
        <li>Passion - every desire is focused on the goal</li>
        <li>Influence - their words create a community/following</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While Dave might not be the typical choice for a hero, he puts these qualities to 
        work each day. Dave Portnoy may be scrutiniezed by many but just like Dr. King, Dave 
        doesn't pay any mind to the haters. Each day Barstool looks to expand their reach and 
        it is thanks to Mr. Portnoy. The sporting and entertainment world has been forever changed 
        in part to this great leader.
